### Welcome to my recipe book on life. A platform filled with life lessons, personal advice and many more. 


This blog has always been an idea of mine, but seeing as the opportunity has arisen, now is the perfect time to do so. But first, let me introduce myself to you.


Hi, I'm Hakima, currently 18 years old and stil trying to figure how to do this life thing. I thought having a platform for the lesson I've learnt for other people to read and to gain knowledge from would be a good place to start.  As one thing I've learnt in life, is that sometimes you should just go for it. You never know what might come from it.
